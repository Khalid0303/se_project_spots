# Spots

An image-sharing platform inspired by adventure and passion.

## Description

**Spots** is a unique platform that celebrates the spirit of discovery and connection. Drawing inspiration from Bessie Coleman, the first African-American and Native American female aviator, **Spots** combines the thrill of exploring new hobbies with the excitement of sharing these passions with others. Just as Coleman broke barriers in aviation, **Spots** encourages users to break through boundaries by embracing new hobbies and exploring personal interests.

With **Spots**, users can:

- Discover and explore a wide range of hobbies, from aviation and art to music and more.
- Share their own hobbies, stories, and inspirations with a vibrant community.
- Learn about Bessie Coleman’s groundbreaking journey and find inspiration in her daring pursuit of her dreams.

Whether you’re taking your first steps into a new hobby or looking to deepen your expertise, **Spots** provides the tools and resources to spark creativity, foster connections, and honor the legacy of those who inspire us to dream big.
